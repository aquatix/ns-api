Installation
------------

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

Assuming you already are inside a virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nsapi

From Git
~~~~~~~~

Create a new virtualenv (if you are not already in one) and install the
necessary packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/aquatix/ns-api.git
    cd ns-api
    mkvirtualenv ns-api
    pip install -r requirements.txt

As part of ns-notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, follow the installation instructions of `ns-notifications`_,
which makes extensive use of this library to serve notifications to for
example a smartphone. The requirements of both packages can be installed
in the same ``ns-notifications`` one mentioned in the project;
``ns-api`` will be installed through pip from
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nsapi>`__.

Also take a look at nsmaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bart Römgens created `a fascinating contour map called nsmaps <https://github.com/bartromgens/nsmaps>`__ based on ns-api. It visualises Dutch railways travel information with OpenLayer 3 contour maps to show how long it takes to get somewhere in the Netherlands by train and bicycle.

Example application
-------------------

For example, I use the library to push notifications about my route to
my phone through `Pushbullet <http://pushbullet.com>`__. The program I
use to do this has its own repository: `ns-notifications`_.

NS API key
~~~~~~~~~~

To actually be able to query the `Nederlandse Spoorwegen
API <http://www.ns.nl/api/api>`__, you `need to request a
key <https://www.ns.nl/ews-aanvraagformulier/>`__. Provide a good reason
and you will likely get it mailed to you (it might take some days).
